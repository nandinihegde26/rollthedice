# rollthedice
This Python code uses the `random` module to simulate rolling a dice, generating random numbers between 1 and 6.
This Python program simulates rolling a dice. Here's a brief description:

1. **`diceroll` Function**:
   - It simulates a dice roll by randomly selecting a number between 1 and 6 from the `choices` list using `random.choice()`.

2. **Main Function**:
   - The program repeatedly prompts the user to roll the dice.
   - After each roll, it displays the randomly selected number.
   - The user is asked if they want to roll again.
   - If the user chooses anything other than "y", the program ends with the message ":THE END:".

This simple loop allows for continuous dice rolls until the user decides to stop.
